The US Phone Number Validator is a web application developed using React that allows users to input and validate US phone numbers in real-time. The app leverages regular expressions (regex) to validate the phone number format, ensuring that the input matches the standard US phone number patterns. It checks for optional country codes, area codes, and valid phone number formats that include spaces or dashes.

Key Features:

Real-Time Validation: As users enter a phone number, the app checks the validity using a regex pattern that supports optional country codes, area codes in parentheses, and various phone number formats with or without dashes/spaces.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
Clear and Interactive UI: The user interface is simple yet intuitive, with clear feedback messages displayed in green for valid numbers and red for invalid ones.
React State Management: Built with React using the useState hook to manage form input and validation results. This makes the application highly interactive and responsive to user input.
CSS Styling: Custom styling for the application is done using CSS, with a focus on a clean and modern design, including responsive layouts and media queries for smaller screen sizes.
This project highlights my proficiency in React, regular expressions, and responsive web design, and is a part of my ongoing journey to build practical, user-friendly web applications.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
